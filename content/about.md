Hola :)

My name is Miguel and I've recently turned 20.
I'm a student at CPI Los Enlaces, Zaragoza, and soon-to-be Higher Technician in Web Development.

Being deeply interested in technology and helping others has always been a part of me. Hence, I chose my current studies as a way of personal achievement and improving my knowledge in that field. I believe that I am very versatile, optimistic, and creative when it comes to solving problems, and I consider myself a very communicative and easygoing person.

Traveling is one of my favorite hobbies, and I've been to many different countries, including Italy, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Czech Republic, United Kingdom and Croatia.

In the summer of 2021, I had the opportunity to work abroad in Croatia thanks to the Erasmus+ program. I spent 2 months in the city of Zagreb, where I worked as a helpdesk technician in a company called "Procudo". I had a great time there, and I learned a lot about the Croatian culture and language.

I'm also one of the Spanish Erasmus+ ambassadors from the [EuroApprentices](http://sepie.es/iniciativas/euroapprentices/index.html) European network willing to share my Erasmus+ experience with other students and encourage them to take part in it. I'm very proud to be part of this project and I hope to continue contributing to it in the future. You can find more information about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJ83xljX1kM).

I'm currently trying to learn as much as possible about the Web Development field, and I'm also trying to improve my English skills.

I hope you enjoy my website!
